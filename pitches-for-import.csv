7993629,SmartTool Editors / Use AI to swap out placeholders for SmartLinks,There might be a confidence score or something for automatic swaps vs something that needs manual review.,Solving existing pain points,AI can help me both identify the placeholders in the imported content along with the replacement.,,,"As a SmartTool builder in the Tapestry space, I have content imported from the 3rd party payors that needs to be updated to swap out placeholders with Epic's SmartLinks. This is a very time consuming process to identify these placeholders (which are formatted differently from document to document) and also find the correct SmartLink to use instead. As an end user, after importing my SmartPhrases from another organization I need to replace non-Epic released SmartLinks and non-user SmartLists with the correct SmartTool for the new organization. This is a tedious and time consuming process that takes time away from caring for patients.",,"We might want to develop/SU something for tracking time it takes to make these updates without any big changes. However, that is not something that has a really obvious thing to measure besides time in activity until placeholders are resolved.",This change could be a big time saver for builders and end users (depending on who uses it).
7993631,Infrastructure / CREATE MASTERFILE FOR SMARTTOOLS CONTEXTS,,,"Create a new INI for storing SmartTools contexts. Have that include a hierarchy so SmartLinks available to ""patient"" (ex: DOB, patient name, etc) are automatically available to anything more specific. Have the SmartText Editor change what cards are available based on the chosen contexts so header/footer configuration options are available when someone is building a letter template no matter how they opened the SmartText Editor.",,,"As a builder within the Epic system, SmartTool contexts make my life harder than it needs to be: Epic releases SmartLinks, but they aren't available in the fields I want them to be. They are available in some activities within the patient chart, but not others that it should be. I then need to create copies of the Epic SmartLinks with makes future maintenance harder with more records fall out of sync with other changes Epic has made. I have a hard time figuring out what context to list on a SmartText so it shows up in the activity within the patient chart but not in other places where it doesn't make sense. When building SmartTexts, I don't have the options available to me that I always want to configure and instead need to switch between different SmartText Editor activities to do everything I want. For example, I can use the Letter Template Editor to build a letter template and configure headers/footers. However, I need to switch to the SmartText Editor to be able to configure overrides to use a different letter template when the letter is created for a child instead of an adult. As an Epic developer / TS: Creating a new SmartTool context is time consuming because I need to update many SmartLinks to include that new context so I instead typically just use MR Charting / IP Charting because its quick and easy for clinical focused SmartLinks. I don't know what SmartTool contexts I should all list when creating a new SmartLinks so I just copy something from an existing SmartLink or mark it as being available to all contexts even though it doesn't make sense to be used to billing / patient access workflows.",,,Saves time / mental load for Epic and customers.
7993912,Improve comparison with original text,Seamless integration with our current comparison UI. Discoverable without being intrusive. Facilitates accurate and more efficient review of generated text.,,"We have three ideas for fixing this: Highlight key medical terms between the original content and the AI generated content when viewing the two side by side. This could look like highlighting the word ""concussion"" so a clinician can see if this key word was preserved, omitted, or added through a hallucination. Highlight numbers between the original content and the AI generated content when viewing the two side by side. This could look like highlighting key lab values, vitals, dates, or other numbers so a clinician can see if these numbers were preserved, omitted, or added through a hallucination. Create a ""metal detector"" option. The idea here is a user could hover over a word in either the AI generated content or the original content. All instances of that word between the AI generated content and original content would then be highlighted, making it easier for users to spot what was preserved, omitted, or added through a hallucination.",,,"Currently, when a user runs a text action on a selected block of text, they are able to view the original text in a bubble for comparison. However, in the case of text actions that make minimal changes (e.g. Fix spelling and grammar), it can be difficult to spot the differences. This makes it more likely that a user would click Looks Good without thoroughly reviewing the generated text, allowing hallucinations or other discrepancies to slip through. The same holds true for text actions that are geared towards reformatting the text (e.g. Format as list). Additionally, for text actions that make larger changes to the text (e.g. Summarize), it can be painstaking to match each piece of generated text to the corresponding original text in the bubble. This either results in users taking longer than ideal to verify the summary or forgo proper review to save time. In the latter case, not only could hallucinations slip through, but also key omissions.",,,Users have requested this in demos and usability testing sessions.
7993933,Support pinning as quick button,Discoverable. Allows users quick access to the text actions they use most. Space efficient.,,"Allow users the option to pin text actions to the SmartTextBox toolbar as a quick button, similar how items under the Epic button work. Once pinned this way, users would be able to run these text actions with a single click, rather than needing to open the text action drop down menu first. To save space, we could use the icon of the category the text action falls under (one of the 4 below), only showing the display name if multiple pinned buttons are present for a single category.",,,"Currently, users have the ability to pin text actions such that they appear at the top of the drop down menu for text actions. Beyond requiring a minimum of two clicks to run such text actions, we currently limit the pinned list to five entries before additional items fall into a More menu, all but eliminating the point of pinning them.",,,Requested in usability testing sessions. The current behavior of pinned items beyond the fifth falling into a More menu was particularly disliked.
7993935,AI Text Assistant / Switch to two-column menu,Space efficient. Allows for quick access to the most possible text actions. Extensible.,,"We should make the menu two columns that span the width of the search field, similar to the Epic button. This would also facilitate us fixing QAN 7881495 by turning the main toolbar and Adjust split buttons into regular submenus.",,,"Currently, as the user begins running and pinning text actions, the drop down menu can grow very tall. Pinning a sixth item then collapses Recent into a submenu while introducing a More menu to the Pinned section, making these items less accessible. In either case, the menu is tall enough that it limits are ability to add more categories in the future (such as Shared Text Actions) without further obstructing the surrounding UI.",,,"Usability testing showed people disliked having pinned items beyond the fifth fall into a More menu, yet letting this list grow unbounded would causes other usability issues. Additionally, with our plan to support sharing text actions, a new category submenu will likely soon be needed, growing our current one column menu beyond what we deemed its limit. We're also now introducing the ability for individual workflows to add their own categories, further increasing the need to move categories to their own column."
6191585,Support spell check in standalone,Likely using Wintertree to keep things consistent.,"Solve pain points, software must work",Add the spell checker to work in a browser!,,,"As an end user, I like using the Epic system directly from a web browser because it is quicker to log in to and I don't need to keep the Hyperdrive app updated. I know I can't use Dragon and some other non-Epic apps like tap badgers for authentication, but I also can't use the spell checker which Epic provides. This means my notes have a lot of misspellings making me look unprofessional. I also can't use simple text expansions so when I type ""afib"" it gets expanded to ""Atrial fibrillation"" so the patients reading my notes in MyChart know what I'm talking about.",,,"Standalone use will likely pick up whether that is directly in a browser on a Windows or Mac (instead of using the Hyperdrive app), Chromebooks, or other platforms. Training will start using Standalone very soon and Standalone could possibly help get users back on the system earlier after malware attacks where spell checking would be missing functionality."
6855847,Create an easier way to have vanishing tips,SmartSection!,,"If Epic created a new way to adding disappearing help text to a note that would allow me, and the analysts that help me, be more efficient.",,Overall improvement.,"As a physician builder for my specialty, I want to provide hints, tips, or other types of information that show up in a note when it is being edited, but disappear when the note is signed to not clutter the note. I can use an optional SmartList, but there are a number of issues with this: The SmartLinks I want to pull in sometimes include colons in the text which prevents signing the note. My analysts tell me there are issues with my build when they try to move it to production using Data Courier when I use a colon in the text where Data Courier finds the wrong SmartList or doesn't update the optional SmartList's record ID correctly.",,,Questions about this come up every couple weeks which means it happens more frequently and aren't getting reported to the development team.
7992604,Spell Check - Compile Wintertree from Source for Windows Version of Hyperdrive Plugin,,,,,,"When we first created the Spell Check Plugin for Hyperdrive, we used the pre-compiled Sentry Spell Check Engine (SSCE) from Wintertree. This same component was already in use in the VB Spell Checker. When we added support for macOS, we couldn't use the pre-compiled DLL because it is specific to Windows. So we purchased a new, more expensive license to obtain Wintertree's source code so that we could compile SSCE from source for macOS. Currently, we have both licenses, and we are still using the pre-compiled DLL for Windows. Our older license for the pre-compiled Windows-specific DLL will soon lapse. But it doesn't make sense to renew that license because we can just compile SSCE from source for Windows like we do for macOS. As an added bonus, compiling SSCE from source gives us more control. For instance, it opens the door for supporting unicode in the future.",,,
7989552,RTF/HTML - Lightweight RTF Component for Views,"Being able to simply render RTF as HTML by setting a string value on a component would be a huge win. If we could also pull in all/most of the extra bells and whistles we are able to support in ReportViewer workflows (attribution, low vision, etc.) that would be a complete package.",This aligns with Epic's priorities to innovate with system intelligence to reduce developer overhead and frustration. This aligns with SmartTools' team priorities to solve existing pain points.,"Ideally, we could provide a lightweight component which is somewhere between a full ReportViewer and a simple DOM element wrapped around a string. This would remove a large amount of duplicative/boilerplate code and make it simpler for new views to include RTF-backed content.",true,"This will definitely require more testing/maintenance, as it will essentially be a new ""product"" for developers. However, it will also help alleviate some of the app-specific issues we encounter and allow us an easy way to test ""realistic"" setups by avoiding one-off situations.","Developers do not have a complete set of options for easily displaying RTF-backed content in their views. The wiki calls out that the ReportViewer is an ideal container because of the extra functionality it provides. Without the ability to use one (which is sometimes the case), developers have to fall back to setting something like ""dangerouslySetInnerHTML"" on a component and dealing with the risks (and shortcomings) of native HTML rendering.","This fits our mission on several levels. First, it helps create a consistency between different implementations of RTF viewing in Hyperspace by avoiding app-specific implementation discrepancies. It will help improve efficiency of others by avoiding duplicative/boilerplate code in all of the application codebases. By adding this functionality, we make it easier for developers to consume RTF-backed content and make it easier to do the ""right thing"". Lastly, this helps make out tools easier to access by other Epic developers.","Success will be measured by being able to remove all (or at least almost all) direct implementations of the RTF-to-HTML APIs and instead route them through components which we control (and can, therefore, standardize).","Now that web transitions are done, people are looking for ways to do new things and have already started reaching out (Varghese Mathew would be interested in hearing about any updates here). Additionally, now that we are no longer bound by IE limitations, we could start looking on implementing PRJ 287784 to optimize/simplify the HTML we output. By adding an extra level of abstraction we can get around a lot of the struggles we have had fighting against CSPs."
7987877,Text Actions to Use Patient's Name and Preferred Pronouns,Correctly changes the patient's name and pronouns to their preferred name and pronouns. Doesn't change other person's name/pronoun if mentioned in the content. Meet other criteria we had for text action to ensure safety.,Continue making progress on the AI Text Assistant as it's one of the starter kit AI features that is quickly being broadly adopted across the Epic community.,"Make it so that whenever a user runs a text action over text, the model will automatically swap in the patient's preferred name and pronouns, making it easy for the clinician to do the right thing. With DLG 2153040, we now send the patient's preferred name and pronouns with all defined and custom text actions. We have a line in the prompt that reads as The patient's name is <preferred first name> and the patient's pronouns are <subject><object><possessive>. This means the AI model will use the correct names and pronouns if generating from scratch or acting on text without names/pronouns. What we actually want though is for the AI model to be more assertive and always use the correct name and pronouns.",,Testing is likely pretty involved. Maintain can potentially be high if we are adding this extra piece to all prompt meaning we need to verify it for model upgrade/and other changes.,"Clinicians using ambient often get a response that does not use the patient's correct pronouns. Other times, clinicians writing text, such as in a note, use sterile language like ""Patient presents for multiple conditions. They are accompanied by their father"". Other times, a clinician uses pronouns and/or names for the patient, but may not be using the patient's preferred name or pronouns. All this means the patient is not being referred to in the way they want to be, which has an impact on trust, bias, and quality of health care received.",,Direct feedback. Feature tracking metrics on accept rate and usage.,A top request from Mayo is for a text action to update patient's pronouns. We could accomplish this in a more generic way than a dedicated text action though.
7987855,Improve Context Menu Usability,Show less options but also reduce the need of digging into deeper menus to find the option.,"Solving existing pain points, such as ideas frequently reported during immersion, submitted through ideas.epic.com, or from other forms of feedback.","As a physician, I would recommend implementing a system that intelligently tracks and analyzes user habits to optimize their experience. By monitoring usage patterns, the system can automatically tailor the available options to align with the individual's preferences and needs. This personalized approach not only enhances user satisfaction but also promotes more efficient and effective utilization of resources.",true,,"As a physician, I want a streamlined context menu with only the most relevant options, so that I can quickly and easily find and use the features I need most often without being overwhelmed by unnecessary choices.",,Measure by clicking and time the user goes to submenu.,"Saving time, reduce cluster, meet the simplification goal."
7983256,SmartTextBox - RTL Update and TS Migration,Having all of the RTL-related logic included in TypeScript instead of JavaScript should be sufficient to solve this completely.,This aligns with Epic's priorities to innovate with system intelligence to improve user/developer efficiency. This aligns with SmartTools' team priorities to help maintain our high quality product by enforcing type safety like we do elsewhere in our codebase.,"As a developer, I want to convert the existing TextLine logic into one or more TypeScript files before implementing numerous functional changes, so that I can ensure type safety and avoid unnecessary complications that arise from the lack of type safety in other parts of the codebase.",,Theoretically this should help with lowering long-term maintenance costs as we will get more for free with the TypeScript platform.,"As a developer, I want the TextLine.js component of the SmartTextBox codebase to be converted from raw JavaScript to TypeScript, so that it aligns with the rest of the codebase. This will ensure type safety, improve code readability, and facilitate easier maintenance and implementation of RTL-related updates, ultimately enhancing the functionality and usability of the templates for end users.",It will help improve efficiency and code stability by providing more structure around one of our most-sensitive areas.,Having all of the RTL-related logic included in TypeScript instead of JavaScript should be sufficient to solve this completely.,"We are actively pursuing new RTL changes in the near future (touched on in QAN 7938948), and this type of restructuring is better to be done before any large functional changes."
7983072,SmartTextBox - Inline Header/Footer Support,A good solution would allow users to always view the most up-to-date rendering of the header/footer content while still allowing them to hot-swap with a different record and share that header/footer information across templates without duplicate records.,This aligns with Epic's priorities to innovate with system intelligence to reduce clinician burnout and improve user efficiency. This aligns with SmartTools' team priorities to solve existing pain points.,"One potential solution would be to leverage this existing implementation and simply echo the content back to the underlying SmartText records which stores the ""body"" of the header/footer. Another option would be to leverage SmartSections, as that already has a concept for a single document which is maintained in multiple locations.",,"In a way this would require additional maintenance/testing, since this will be additional logic, but ultimately it will be similar to what we would already have. We are simply going to make the content render similarly regardless of your decisions around storage/interoperability.","Complex documents, such as letters, may desire to leverage header and/or footer segments to meet their needs. Sometimes this is due to external requirements (3rd party content, governmental forms, etc.) while other times it is just to make things look better for their users/patients. Managing these headers and footers is currently a bit cumbersome, as the SubSystem component did not provide a good mechanism for what was needed. Sometimes the header/footer content is specific to that unique template record while other times it may be shared across records. In either case, current templates support only the disjointed header/footer records.","This fits our mission on several levels. First, it helps create a consistency between our editor and MS Word (as well as other similar tools). It will help improve efficiency by allowing edits to happen directly within the SmartTextBox instead of requiring sending back and forth between the STB and a 3rd party application (for the embedded header/footer cases). By adding this functionality, we make it easier for users to build and expand on existing SmartTools, simplifying the steps involved and making it easier to do the right thing. Lastly, this helps make users' SmartTools more of a joy to use because they can create more user-friendly, modern content.",Success could be measured by ensuring that we can properly render header/footer content using both the historical implementation (separate ETX records) as well as the new implementation being worked up for Tapestry.,The recent push to allow Tapestry to embed header/footer information within the templates themselves (PRJ 338470) illustrates that there is a need which we are not fully meeting. Part of the hesitation around implementing this outside of Tapestry is that downstream workflows may not be able to function without expecting the header/footer content to be defined externally.
7983035,Display SmartLists with Few Options as Option List in SmartTextBox,Good UX.,,Users will be able to see and pick SmartList options with a single click.,,,"SmartList require users to click into the list, and then make a selection. It would be much more efficient if for short lists, particularly Yes/No, or similar, we had the options inline, similar to an option list.",,,Simplifies the end user workflow for common workflows.
7975409,SmartTextBox - Improved Shape Support,"Ideally, we would be able to construct any document which a user can do in MS Word, to avoid the dependence on that 3rd party product. A more likely situation is that we would be able to properly handle any document which our users receive from their vendors, or at least be able to take it in and bend it to our will in terms of layout.",This aligns with Epic's priorities to innovate with system intelligence to reduce clinician burnout and improve user efficiency. This aligns with SmartTools' team priorities to solve existing pain points.,"A user may need to take a document from a third party (such as an insurance provider) and implement it as a SmartText record to be able to integrate it into other Epic workflows such as letters or other communication methods. Once it is inside of the SmartTextBox, we can allow the user to click-and-drag to move the shape around on-screen, support more advanced wrapping styles, provide mechanisms for editing inner-content, and introduce the ability to create new shapes from scratch.",,"This will likely require a lot of additional testing/maintenance, as the majority of the features needed here are net-new concepts for the SmartTextBox control - that is why they haven't been implemented yet.","Shapes (notably positioned shapes) are sometimes a crucial piece of the puzzle for users to solve a problem at hand. Sometimes it is to meet governmental requirements while other times it is simply finding the best way to fit the necessary content into the limited space available to them. While we support displaying and maintaining some types of shapes which already exist, we have limited options available for actively creating them from scratch, or even simply moving them around within the document. This means that users need to copy and paste from external sources and hope that things copy over correctly, as they are largely unable to modify them after-the-fact.","This fits our mission on several levels. First, it helps create a consistency between our editor and MS Word (as well as other similar tools). It will help improve efficiency by allowing edits to happen directly within the SmartTextBox instead of requiring sending back and forth between the STB and a 3rd party application. By adding this functionality, we make it easier for users to build and expand on existing SmartTools, simplifying the steps involved and making it easier to do the right thing. Lastly, this helps make users' SmartTools more of a joy to use because they can create more user-friendly, modern content.",Success can be measured in levels; we may need to iterate on this across multiple versions to reach the ideal end result. Being able to support documents which customers are encountering will be a great start.,"With the migration of the SmartText editor to web, we are regularly running into situations where users attempt to perform workflows which were previously possible (albeit a bit buggy in some situations) with the SubSystems-backed control."
7974873,SmartTextBox - Manual Jagged Table Cell Creation,"We should be able to re-create any jagged table we find in our test documents from scratch within a web STB. If we can choose a random existing document and recreate it reliably (and without an unnecessary amount of effort compared to other editors), we will be in a good spot.",This aligns with Epic's priorities to innovate with system intelligence to reduce clinician burnout and improve user efficiency. This aligns with SmartTools' team priorities to solve existing pain points.,,,"This will add some new options for testing moving forward. Realistically, these types of workflows should probably be tested now - we will just be changing the expected behaviors to be more helpful ones.",,"This fits our mission on several levels. First, it helps create a consistency between our editor and MS Word (as well as other similar tools). It will help improve efficiency by avoiding the need for users to migrate their content between Epic and a 3rd party application to make (seemingly) minor edits. By improving this functionality, we make it easy for users to expand on existing SmartTools, as many templates (ETX, HH1) involve tables and many of those tables are jagged in some way. Lastly, this helps make users' SmartTools easier to build and hopefully more of a joy to use because of that.","We should be able to re-create any jagged table we find in our test documents from scratch within a web STB. If we can choose a random existing document and recreate it reliably (and without an unnecessary amount of effort compared to other editors), we will be in a good spot.","We have received many concerns over users struggling to recreate 3rd party documents for things such as insurance or governmental forms, where matching styling is very important. Similarly, label-based workflows have encountered struggles when attempting to best-utilize the limited space available on their size of labels."
7968764,Make the Text Assistant Context Aware,,System intelligence improvements.,"Build a generic infrastructure that allows app team devs to pass relevant context for their workflows to the AI Text Assistant. For IB, this could look like devs passing IB Insights and the last patient message. For OP Notes, this could look like passing the patient chart summary. For IP and ED notes, this could look like passing IP and ED insights. Clinicians using the text assistant would then likely get far better and more tailored responses.",,,"When a clinician uses the AI text assistant, it will give responses that clearly do not pay attention to the surrounding context. This means responses are less useful than they could be and it makes the tool less useful and usable. An example is in In Basket, where the model doesn't understand most information about the patient or what the last patient message was, making it difficult for it to suggest useful responses to the patient.",,Consider feature tracking logging once for each context aware text action that is available and another for each time it gets used. Consider logging / reporting for the individual text action for more granular data.,"This gives us a chance to stand on our hill of having a deeply integrated system. No other AI editing tool can integrate with the rest of the patient's chart in the way we can. This is a clear differentiator and potentially makes using the text assistant consistently more useful than going to ChatGPT, not just more convenient and safer."
7968293,Use MFT Data to Autofit/Simplify Rich Text STB Toolbar,"Our current default options actually look quite good based on usage data. This makes sense if you assume most people don't customize their toolbar to add buttons to it that are tucked away. Some initial ideas: Create SmartPhrases is one that might not be used as frequently as the others, but it could be kept in the default toolbar because it doesn't have a hotkey. It doesn't seem necessary to add any well-used formatting options since we have the floating formatting toolbar. This would be a good opportunity to evaluate if we can get rid of Next/Last to push users to use other ways of moving between SmartLists.",,"Now that we have feature tracking data of STB buttons (SmartTextbox - Power BI Report Server), we should consider adjusting the default rich-text STB toolbar for users we don't have usage data for, and to leverage the auto-fit dev to auto-fit the toolbar when we do have data available for a user. We have been able to collect usage data for Fred, which shows that there are four buttons he clicks regularly but that he clicks other buttons very infrequently. Depending on how we want to approach the design, we could consider removing all other buttons from his toolbars so that he only has those four buttons in them (while giving him the option to decline the autofit suggestion if he would prefer).",,,"Fred views Hyperspace as being complex and cluttered, since there are features onscreen that he doesn't need to use. One way to simplify the system for Fred would be to tuck away low-use actions. While Fred clicks some of the buttons in the rich text STB toolbar during his workday, he uses hotkeys for some others and does not regularly click them all. He sees the STB toolbar less frequently around Hyperspace now that they have been tucked away in plain text SmartTextBoxes, but buttons in the rich-text STB toolbar that he doesn't use still add clutter.",It will be consistent with implementing auto-fit for the plain text STB and our mission to simplify SmartTextBoxes in general.,"Reduced clutter scores in the report, feedback from users adopting autofit.",We're already planning to incorporate auto-fit into our plain text STB project by auto-pinning a users' most frequently used buttons. This would be a good opportunity to leverage the functionality further for the rich text STB.
7967434,Show Where SmartTexts Are Configured Beyond SmartTool Records,Automatically works for any new item that networks to ETX. Works with the INI/record ID pairs used for E3P values.,"Solving existing pain points, such as ideas frequently reported during immersion, submitted through ideas.epic.com, or from other forms of feedback.","A generic report that can show any place a SmartText is used (within certain limitations -- code/static INI, item must be networked to ETX, etc) will make my life easier because I can find places a SmartText is plugged in within needing to maintain a tracker spreadsheet.",,"None, but can make maintenance quicker and easier overall.","As an analyst, I find SmartText maintenance difficult because I have a hard time finding where a given SmartText is all used when looking outside of other SmartTool records.",,Probably direct feedback.,Ease of maintenance is a focus area to allow analysts to do more.
7964399,Mac / Accessibility APIs Can't Detect Text in SmartTextBox,Ideally vendor agnostic.,,"One relatively quick fix for this issue of ""opaqueness"" of the smart note editor would be to have the note editor surface a representation of its contents to the AX API, e.g. by setting the value of its aria-description attribute to a JSON serialization of its content and current selection.",,Low once developed.,"As a user, I can't use Nabla or Abridge to dictate into SmartTextBoxes within Hyperspace for MacOS. This means Hyperspace for MacOS isn't as usable as Hyperdrive for Windows is because I, and my colleagues, greatly prefer to use speech to text over typing.",,"Physicians at Emory, Cedars, and others start using Hyperspace for MacOS instead of Hyperdrive for Windows.",This is a key reason that physicians at Emory switched back to using Hyperdrive for Windows instead of Hyperspace for MacOS.
7963374,Support Render Rich Text Content in Plain Text STB,Flexible and safe. Don't open a loop hole of allow any random rich text to be inserted into plain text STB.,"Support app team commitments, including pair programming, PQA, charters, QA passes, design review, or dev. Continue making progress on the AI Text Assistant as it's one of the starter kit AI features that is quickly being broadly adopted across the Epic community.","Ideally, we would have a way to load, parse and render rich text content in plain text STB so that AI citation workflow won't really rely on rich text STB and application can use the general AI citation RTF API for their use cases.",,Full ST owned infrastructure.,"Some teams would like to use AI SmartLink with AI citations but in plain text STB. We already support rendering AI SmartLink return as AI SmartSection in plain text STB. However, citation itself is a rich text concept in SmartText Box and based on RTF markup.

7963351,Enhance SmartLink User Parameter for Segmented Parameter Validation,,,"On a high level, we would like to enhance the SmartLink that can build all types of EpicCommand link with good validation and simple UI so it's easier for average user to build a link without having to build out the delimited string manually. For the generic SmartLink we will have two parameters: EpicCommand type - custom search type parameter that returns the available EpicCommand(This is done in DLG 2049486), and Parameters - segmented parameter with two segments: parameterType and parameterValue with dynamic validation.",,,"DLG 2049486 is proposing a new SmartLink to allow building EpicCommand link using SmartLink user entered parameter. Because of technical limitations of the SmartLink user parameter popup, user still need to manually build the delimited string for the EpicCommand link parameter.",,,"Saves build time for EpicCommand link. Work is being done in this area right now, but it is fairly bare bones without this proposed development."
7945918,Improve Automated Testing for Model Responses for the Text Assistant,Devs and QMs can easily test new prompts and spot issues with prompt changes. Devs and QMs have limited manual work to do for each quarterly upgrade. We build a good example for other AI projects to follow. We have good systems built out for testing internationalized prompts.,"First, do no harm - have better systems in place to catch glaring issues that may arrise. Innovate with system intelligence. Continue making progress on the text assistant.","Build out the same type of testing for our two custom text action prompts. Expand the testing for defined text actions and this new testing for custom text actions to work for all other primary locales. Clearly document how to generate these outputs, so when devs are making prompt changes in the future, they can easily run this automated testing to see the impact of the changes they've made. Work with translators and other AI projects to build an example of how this can scale and work well across other AI features.",,,"Each time Microsoft upgrades their AI models or we want to switch to a new model, QMs and devs on Notes and SmartTools spend time manually reviewing and testing our prompts to see if they perform well or need any changes. This problem will only increase in magnitude as we aim to support all primary languages.",Software must work - our prompts are designed to work as well as possible and we catch issues before they get to our customers. Generalize to benefit more - we can set precedent here for other teams across Epic to follow in building out good automated testing.,,"SmartTools is taking over more prompt ownership, meaning it's important for us to support our QM with better automated testing."

The system finds the relevant SmartLinks, then returns some number of results based on confidence as a SmartList that will pull in the found SmartLinks.",,,"Users frequently have difficulty finding a SmartLink that pulls in the data that they need. This can be relatively simple data, a SmartLink that they know exists because it's in a template, or something that they aren't sure exists but need for the first time. On immersion, I've been asked about a range of these, from ones that they probably should have learned during training (ME) to ones that are much more niche (ADMPROV, the pile of LABS SmartLinks, the various HISTORY SmartLinks). We have the Find SmartLinks report, but not many people know about it, and it's disruptive to people's workflows.",Make it easy for users to do the right thing by reducing the time and mental load to find and share SmartTools.,,"This has been an issue for a long time, but AI classification makes the system intelligence required much more feasible than it would have been previously."

Analysts and AI project managers can get details on how often safeguards are being hit by different users without reaching out to TS. Ideally, analysts and AI project managers can get details on how custom text actions are being used without reaching out to a TS. From talking to Brian Jacobson and Katie, a lawyer at Mercy, auditing this tool, including customers ability to save prompts longer than 30 days, is important.",This aligns with Epic's priorities to innovate with system intelligence to reduce clinician burnout and improve user efficiency.

To get more details, they will have to reach out to TS to pull data from the global tracking all prompts that are written, then manually go through this data. This is tedious, slow, and will not scale well. Currently, organizations default to saving off each prompt that is sent for 30 days.",We want to make it easy for our users to do the right thing. Improving reporting and auditing of custom text actions makes it easier for our customers to roll out this powerful tool in a more ethical and safe way.,,"Custom text actions are now live in prod at a few orgs. Not having good reporting and auditing could be a barrier to rolling this feature out more broadly.

There could also be an HDF setting to allow organizations to turn this feature off if they don't think SmartPhrases should ever be private. Private SmartPhrases should able to be changed back to public SmartPhrases at any point and vice versa, and allow it to be shared limitedly if users are added as editors so it can be shared if the owner gives permission.",This fits ST priorities because it would solve long standing existing pain points.,"Allow end users the choice to hide their SmartPhrases that aren't appropriate for others to use, preventing other users from searching or sharing SmartPhrases without the user's permission. This will make end users feel like they have control over their SmartPhrases.",,,"Users might create a SmartPhrase for a signature that doesn't make sense for other people to have access to or as a personal reference that isn't meant for others to use. If other people use their private SmartPhrases, this can make them feel like their privacy has been violated or annoyed that they can't control their personal smartphrases.",It will improve effectiveness because users already have the signature SmartPhrases but it will increase trust and feelings of security if they know that their personal information can't be taken by others.,SmartPhrases can be made private.,It was recently marked as a potential SPRE by a customer because they saw it as such a concern and it is regularly requested in ideas.epic.com.

They also couldn't highlight text that they wanted to emphasize and bolding or changing word color just doesn't catch attention like highlights do.,"It would improve efficiency with documentation by allowing users to remove highlighting they don't want without having to un-highlight in external programs or cut/paste as plain text but that would remove all other formatting too. If the highlighting is throughout a document, it's really inefficient to try to fix each individual line that has highlighting. It also would improve effectiveness of documentation because leaving in unnecessary highlighting might call attention to something while more important information for this context is skipped. It can also make the most important parts of a note or template really stand out, much more than bolding.",Can users highlight and remove highlighting within the STB.,"We have been getting this request regularly, including from 4 months ago.

2005922,Prevent Parts of a Note Template from Being Deleted,Allow sections of a SmartText to be required in a note in a way that makes deleting it difficult.,This fits ST priorities because it would solve long standing existing pain points.,"Add a SmartLink that could be used similarly to a sectioning SmartLink but nothing in that section can be deleted in the note. This allows it to be more flexible and only added to certain parts of a template. We could also make the section more like a warn on delete SmartLink so that if any part of it is about to get deleted, there is a warning saying something like 'this is required documentation, are you sure you want to delete this?' to allow more flexibility for end users. Or maybe have both options with different SmartLinks.",,,Organizational leads and compliance officers often have required SmartLists or documentation that they add for legal reasons. These sections must be filled out but end users can just delete it from any note and not have to do the documentation.,This would be a part of making it easy for users to do the right thing so that required documentation is actually filled out.,Parts of a template can be restricted from being deleted when added to a STB.,

As a physician builder who consistently creating template to be shared, I would expect SmartPhrase to has same feature that SmartText had, preview is the big one. Also a lot of organization feels SmartPhrase actually provides more flexibility and easy to update template with urgent need so they lean toward using SmartPhrase more than SmartText.",,User satisfaction based on directly feedback/immersion. We can have feature tracking on usage of the preview feature which can be done in both POC and PRD.,A long standing pain point.
2430009,SmartLists to Use Capitalization for Sentence Case,"Customizable, allows for proper grammar without the builder having to anticipate where or how the SmartList options will be used.",This fits ST priorities because it would solve long standing existing pain points.,"If the SmartList is multiselect, only respect sentence case in the SmartList for the first selection but not the others. Optionally, add a button in the SmartList editor in case the capitalization should be respected so this option can be opted in or out. Ideally, the SmartList would also remove the capitalization of the first selection if it wasn't the beginning of a paragraph but that might not be feasible.",,,"Multi-select SmartLists are common in STBs but they cause sentences to be gramatically incorrect because the selections may have the first letter capitalized of the word, which makes the sentence look wrong. If the end user is normally a big stickler about grammar, this would probably drive them nuts. If they want to change the letter to fit the sentence, they would have to have a non-refreshable SmartList or remove the reselectability, which makes the tool less efficient to use in the future.",Makes SmartLists more of a joy to use because end users don't have grammatically incorrect sentences all over their notes with no way to correct it.,,

However, when I make changes to these SmartPhrases and upload from PPTH, it creates a second copy at St Elsewhere when I re-download. I would prefer if making changes at PPTH would carry over back to St Elsewhere. Additionally, if I re-upload at St Elsewhere and re-download at PPTH, it overwrote my build changes which wasted hours of work.",,"Useful feature tracking metrics: How often we create multiple versions on a download, How often a user has changed the active version of a SmartPhrase. Would also be good to revisit estimated numbers for how many providers have used this feature at multiple locations (could probably check Epic Earth database).","Losing changes to SmartPhrases could lead to severe provider frustration. Avoiding duplication makes the process less confusing and more cleanly aligns with the mental model of a single source of truth, even if there are still different versions of the SmartPhrase."
