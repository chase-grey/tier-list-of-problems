/**
 * Drag and Drop Test Cases
 * 
 * This file contains manual test scenarios to verify the drag and drop functionality.
 * Run through these tests to ensure everything is working correctly.
 */

/**
 * Basic Drag and Drop Tests
 * 
 * 1. Drag a project card from one column to another
 *    - Verify the card appears in the destination column
 *    - Verify the card is removed from the source column
 *    - Verify the card maintains its appearance and content
 * 
 * 2. Drag a project card within the same column to reorder
 *    - Verify the card moves to the new position
 *    - Verify other cards reflow correctly
 * 
 * 3. Drag a project card to the top of a column
 *    - Verify the card becomes the first item in the column
 * 
 * 4. Drag a project card to the bottom of a column
 *    - Verify the card becomes the last item in the column
 */

/**
 * Edge Case Tests
 * 
 * 1. Drag a card outside all valid drop areas, then back into a column
 *    - Verify the card returns to its original position when dropped outside
 *    - Verify the card can still be dragged again after being dropped outside
 * 
 * 2. Drag quickly and release
 *    - Verify fast drag operations still work correctly
 * 
 * 3. Start dragging, pause for several seconds, then continue
 *    - Verify the drag operation doesn't time out or get stuck
 * 
 * 4. Drag near viewport edges
 *    - Verify scrolling works when dragging near the top or bottom
 *    - Verify the card can be dropped after scrolling
 * 
 * 5. Multiple rapid drag operations
 *    - Perform several drag operations in quick succession
 *    - Verify all state updates happen correctly without race conditions
 * 
 * 6. Drag over other interactive elements
 *    - Verify dragging over buttons or other cards doesn't cause issues
 */

/**
 * Accessibility Tests
 * 
 * 1. Keyboard navigation
 *    - Verify tab focus works on draggable items
 *    - Verify keyboard commands work for drag operations
 * 
 * 2. Screen reader compatibility
 *    - Verify appropriate ARIA attributes are set
 *    - Verify announcements during drag operations
 * 
 * 3. Reduced motion support
 *    - Verify animations are reduced when prefers-reduced-motion is enabled
 */

/**
 * Performance Tests
 * 
 * 1. Drag with many cards (20+) in columns
 *    - Verify drag operations remain smooth
 *    - Verify no visible lag when dragging
 * 
 * 2. Rapid sorting
 *    - Move many cards quickly between columns
 *    - Verify state remains consistent
 *    - Verify UI updates without lag
 */

/**
 * Mobile/Touch Tests
 * 
 * 1. Touch drag operations
 *    - Verify touch dragging works on mobile devices
 *    - Verify long press activates drag on touch devices
 * 
 * 2. Multi-touch interaction
 *    - Verify app handles multi-touch scenarios gracefully
 * 
 * 3. Different sized viewports
 *    - Test on various screen sizes
 *    - Verify responsive behavior during drag operations
